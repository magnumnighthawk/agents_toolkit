# Agents Toolkit

A personal collection of reusable artifacts for building AI agents.

## Contents

### `agent_template.spec.yml`
A YAML template for specifying agent architectures. Covers identity, persona, objectives, memory models, tools, behavior loops, and evaluation criteria.

## Usage

```bash
cp agent_template.spec.yml my_agent.spec.yml
# Edit to define your agent's architecture
```

Use this template to design and document agents before implementation, ensuring consistent structure across projects.
